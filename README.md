### [DrugExtract: Selecting line items from irregular tables](https://github.com/Marmuvar/DrugExtract)

**`DrugExtract`** extracts data from .pdf format files and compiles individual line items from whitespace-delimited tables having irregular entries.  Subsequent steps eliminate duplicates and perform limited data cleaning.  The resultant data tables provided a basis for data analysis in my thesis.
